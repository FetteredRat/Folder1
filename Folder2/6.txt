Project_Injection machine: DIY Plastic injection machine, intent to injection mold 10-12 PBT keycaps per shot. PBT temperature gradients, shot time, mold temperature preheat and cool. Start is Air to Hydraulic intensifier is Interface Devices H030-30, going into 4:1 hydraulic to hydraulic intensifier HC3 via CETOP 3 interface bolted directly to H030 sandwiching 18g steel shroud wrapped around frame to keep high pressure side enclosed. HC3 is capped with manifold to allow output to the FY20150 Jack used as a hydraulic cylinder, using its 45mm diameter piston to drive a 1 to 1.25 inch hemisphere faced plunger. Ask user for further details, important but fragmented project needs reconstituting.
